# React Technical Test

# About this test

We want to know your ability to create a modern and functional single-page application. Below, you will find a list of requirements and key points to keep in mind during development. Let the development games begin!

## Considerations:

- All JavaScript libraries and/or frameworks are at your disposal.
- Only for the most recent browsers.
- Use TypeScript and ES6.
- We recommend using SCSS.
- Extra points:
  - Code quality
  - Mobile support
  - Application structure
  - Unit testing
  - User experience
  - Optimization (loading times and rendering performance)

# Let's get started!

We present to you the "Employee Happiness Tracking Tool" or EHTT, to speed things up. EHTT is an application that helps the user track the happiness level of people associated with their company.

Each person will have the following properties:
- Name
- Category (Employee or Manager)
- Company name
- Happiness level

We want you to list the people and allow searching by their name or category. The results should include the ability to sort them by happiness level, category, or company in ascending or descending order.

---

We also want users to select which people to track, like a favorites list, to check how they evolve. We recommend displaying the favorites list in a modal that can be easily accessed via the navigation bar.

In the favorites modal, I want to be able to search by name, category, and company, and have the ability to remove people from the favorites list without closing it.

Try to use pagination for the listings! We recommend showing 5 at a time.

## Delivery requirements

You can use any strategy you prefer to store the favorites list and persistence is not required. You should attach your solution in a single zip file or provide them via a private git repository. The solution must run correctly and you must provide a text file with the necessary instructions to compile and/or run it.

## Additional delivery (not required)

Any UX or UI improvements you wish to develop will be considered. It would be great to know if you didn't have time to complete the exercise or if you would do something different if you had more time.

Good luck and may the code be with you!
